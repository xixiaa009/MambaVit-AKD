# MambaVit-AKD:Mamba-Vision Transformer with Attention Knowledge Distillation for Missing-modality Brain Tumor Segmentation
This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of our work: Mamba-Vision Transformer with Attention Knowledge Distillation for Missing-modality Brain Tumor Segmentation.
# setup
## Environment
All our experiments are implemented based on the PyTorch framework with 45GB NVIDIA A40 GPU, and we recommend installing the following package versions:
* Python 3.10.9
* PyTorch 2.1.2
# Data preparation
* Download the preprocessed datasets BraTS2020 and BraTS2021
*  Process and store the data in NumPy array format (.npy), see RFNet for more details.
